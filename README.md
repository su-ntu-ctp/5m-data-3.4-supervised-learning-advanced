## Lesson Objectives

* Apply L1 (Lasso), L2 (Ridge) and Elastic Net regularization techniques to regression models to control model complexity and mitigate overfitting.
* Implement machine learning workflow using `sklearn` pipelines with hyperparameter optimization via Cross-Validation and Grid Search.
* Analyze the foundational mechanics of Decision Trees, including splitting criteria like Gini Impurity and Entropy.
* Evaluate distinct ensemble learning strategies by contrasting Bagging and Boosting methodologies and applying advanced algorithms, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and LightGBM, to improve predictive performance.
